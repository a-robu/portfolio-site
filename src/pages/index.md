# Andrei Robu  
**Software Engineer**

I help organisations make custom software easier to understand, safer to change,
and better aligned with the people who rely on it.

I work with teams who have software that already exists, already matters, and
needs to be reliable, trustworthy, and usable in real conditions.

## What I Do

- Understand and de-risk custom software systems  
- Fix internal tools that slow people down  
- Design software for repetitive or high-focus work  
- Investigate stability and performance issues  
- Recover and structure lost system knowledge  

## How This Usually Starts

Often, people come to me because something feels off:
- a system works, but no one really understands it
- internal tools cause friction or quiet frustration
- changes feel risky
- knowledge is scattered or fragile

My job is to help clarify what’s going on and improve things without unnecessary
disruption.
