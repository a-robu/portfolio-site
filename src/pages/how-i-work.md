# How I Work

Good software work is often quiet.

It’s less about heroics and more about clarity, trust, and making systems behave
in ways people can rely on.

## Some Principles

- I try to understand how people actually use systems, not just how they were
  designed.
- I prefer making behaviour visible rather than adding complexity.
- I focus on reducing cognitive load and uncertainty.
- I work within real constraints instead of fighting them.
- I value calm, boring reliability over impressive fragility.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Here are a few examples of the kinds of things I tend to do.

### Making deployments boring  
I’ve rebuilt deployment processes so releases take seconds instead of hours,
with instant rollbacks.  
The biggest change wasn’t speed — it was removing fear from making changes.

### Talking to users until they feel understood  
Often the first thing people ask for isn’t what they actually need.  
I spend time asking questions until people feel understood — that’s usually
where the real requirements emerge.

### Making invisible behaviour visible  
When systems have internal state or complex interactions, I often add visual or
conceptual tools so people can see what’s going on instead of guessing.

### Caring about small details  
Some of my favourite work is on features people don’t notice because they just
work — clear search, intuitive defaults, feedback that arrives at the right
moment.

I aim to leave systems — and the people working with them — more confident than
I found them.
