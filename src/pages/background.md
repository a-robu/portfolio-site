# Background & Experience

My work has mostly been embedded inside organisations rather than delivered as
standalone projects.

That means long-lived systems, real users, operational constraints, and software
that has to keep working while it evolves.

Below is a brief overview of the environments I’ve worked in and the kinds of
work I’ve done there.

## Software Engineer — Cardonet  
*SME IT Managed Service Provider*

At Cardonet, I worked as a web developer on business-critical internal systems
used daily by engineers, support staff, and management.

This was a pragmatic, fast-moving environment where software had to work
reliably for non-technical users under time pressure.

**Key areas of work**
- Designed and built a custom internal helpdesk and operations platform
- Worked directly with engineers and managers to understand real workflows
- Delivered features under live operational constraints
- Improved reliability, deployment processes, and observability
- Built tools to support SLA tracking and operational decision-making

**What this taught me**
- People often feel resigned to software being frustrating — good tools can
  change that
- The first thing users ask for is rarely the real problem
- Reliability and clarity matter more than cleverness

## Postgraduate Researcher & Senior Research Assistant — University of Hertfordshire  
*SocSMCs — HORIZON 2020 Project*

I worked as a postgraduate researcher (PhD programme, not completed) and later
as a senior research assistant on an EU-funded research project.

The work involved experimental systems, modelling, and making sense of complex
data.

**Key areas of work**
- Python-based analysis of experimental and time-series data
- Re-encoding messy datasets into analysable representations
- Building visualisations to support sense-making
- Writing and presenting research for academic audiences
- Conference presentation and a published research paper

**What this taught me**
- Analysis is as much about framing questions as computing answers
- Data rarely arrives in a usable form
- Clear explanation matters just as much as technical correctness

## Software Engineer — Ocado Technology  
*Robotics Simulation & Tooling*

At Ocado Technology, I worked on simulation software used to model and test
robotic grocery picking and packing systems.

This was a large organisation with complex socio-technical dynamics and high
technical ambition.

**Key areas of work**
- Worked on robotics simulation and supporting tooling
- Designed and implemented internal features and services
- Built visual debugging tools to make internal system state visible
- Investigated performance, stability, and memory behaviour
- Improved documentation and shared understanding across teams

**What this taught me**
- Many hard problems are actually understanding problems
- Making invisible behaviour visible reduces conflict and guesswork
- Small improvements to clarity can have outsized impact

## Across These Roles

Across SMEs, academia, and large corporates, a few themes recur in my work:

- Entering complex existing systems and making sense of them
- Talking to people until their real constraints become clear
- Reducing friction, error, and cognitive load in daily work
- Improving reliability without dramatic rewrites
- Leaving systems calmer and easier to work with than I found them

This experience informs how I approach the services I offer today.
