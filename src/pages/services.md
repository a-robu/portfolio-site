# Services
I offer focused engineering and consultancy work around existing systems,
internal tools, and complex workflows.

These engagements can be short and targeted, or extend into implementation
depending on what’s needed.

## Understanding & De-Risking a Custom Software System

**Who this is for**  
Teams with custom software that people rely on, but which feels fragile, poorly
understood, or risky to change.

**The problem**  
The system works, but no one is fully confident how it behaves or where the real
risks are.

**What I do**  
I build a clear, shared understanding of how the system actually behaves in
practice.

**What you get**
- A high-level map of components and responsibilities  
- Identification of operational and knowledge risks  
- Clear distinction between safe-to-change and high-risk areas  
- Practical next steps to reduce uncertainty  

**Outcome**  
The system becomes easier to reason about and safer to evolve.

## Fixing Internal Tools That Slow People Down

**Who this is for**  
Organisations where staff rely on internal tools for daily work and feel slowed
down, frustrated, or error-prone.

**The problem**  
Internal tools often grow organically and stop serving the people who use them.

**What I do**  
I work directly with users to understand real workflows and improve usability,
reliability, and clarity.

**What you get**
- Clear identification of friction points  
- Targeted improvements that reduce time and errors  
- Changes that fit existing systems and constraints  

**Outcome**  
Work feels calmer, faster, and more predictable.

## Designing Software for Repetitive or High-Focus Work

**Who this is for**  
Teams building software used repeatedly or under pressure — operators,
technicians, support staff, or engineers working at stations or control
interfaces.

**The problem**  
Small design flaws accumulate into fatigue, confusion, and mistakes.

**What I do**  
I design and implement software that makes system state visible, feedback clear,
and decisions easier.

**What you get**
- Interfaces that surface the right information at the right time  
- Reduced reliance on workarounds or tribal knowledge  
- Tools that support focus rather than fighting it  

**Outcome**  
People trust the software and make better decisions with less effort.

## Stability & Performance Triage

**Who this is for**  
Teams dealing with slow, unstable, or unpredictable systems built with
technologies I work with (Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, MySQL, containerised
services).

**The problem**  
Issues are visible, but causes are unclear and fixes feel risky.

**What I do**  
I investigate real system behaviour and recommend targeted, realistic
improvements.

**What you get**
- Clear explanation of what’s happening and why  
- Identification of the most impactful issues  
- Practical fixes aligned with existing constraints  

**Outcome**  
Fewer surprises and a clearer path forward.

## Recovering & Structuring Lost System Knowledge

**Who this is for**  
Organisations where critical knowledge lives in people’s heads or outdated
documents.

**The problem**  
Lack of shared understanding slows decisions and increases risk.

**What I do**  
I interview stakeholders and study existing systems to create clear, accessible
documentation.

**What you get**
- Clear explanations of how systems work and why  
- Documentation that supports onboarding and decision-making  
- Reduced dependence on individuals  

**Outcome**  
Knowledge becomes shared, durable, and usable.
