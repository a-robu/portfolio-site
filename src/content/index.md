# Andrei Robu — Software Engineer

I'm a software engineer with experience building and maintaining complex,
business-critical systems.

## Areas I've Worked On

- Internal web platforms used daily across a business
- Simulation software for robotics systems
- Python-based analysis of experimental and time-series data

## Experience

- Designing and implementing software features end-to-end
- Improving system reliability and making failures easier to understand
- Performance investigation and optimisation in real systems
- Working across web technologies and backend services
- C#-based systems and simulation environments
- Python-based analysis of experimental and time-series data

## How I Can Help

I'm particularly useful when problems are unclear, when software needs to
support real decision-making, or when technical work benefits from making
complex behaviour visible and inspectable.

## Availability

- Small to medium development projects
- Short consultations to help clarify technical or product problems
